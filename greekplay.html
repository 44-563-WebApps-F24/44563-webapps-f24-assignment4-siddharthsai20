    <p><b>oedipus.</b>How dreadful knowledge of the truth 
        can be when thereâ€™s no help in truth!</p>

    <p><b>tiresias.</b>What will come will come,
         even if I shroud it all in silence.</p>

    <p><b>oedipus.</b>I must know the truth,
         no matter how painful.</p>

    <p><b>tiresias.</b>You are the curse,
         the cause of your own ruin.</p>

    <p><b>oedipus.</b>No! That cannot be true!</p>

    <p><b>tiresias.</b>The truth has been spoken.
         Deny it if you will, but you cannot change fate.</p>

    <p><b>oedipus.</b>I will uncover everything! 
        The truth will come to light!</p>
