    <h4>oedipus.</h4>
    <p>dreadful knowledge of the truth 
        can be when thereâ€™s no help in truth!</p>
    <p>_Oedipus paces the room, visibly disturbed._</p>


    <h4>tiresias</h4>
    <p>What will come will come,
         even if I shroud it all in silence.</p>

    <h4>oedipus</h4>
    <p>I must know the truth,
         no matter how painful.</p>
     <p>_Tiresias turns his gaze toward Oedipus, his expression stern._</p>


    <h4>tiresias</h4>
    <p>You are the curse,
         the cause of your own ruin.</p>
    <p>_Oedipus steps back, shocked._</p>


     <h4>oedipus</h4>
    <p>No! That cannot be true!</p>

    <h4>tiresias</h4>
    <p>The truth has been spoken.
         Deny it if you will, but you cannot change fate.</p>

    <h4>oedipus</h4>
    <p>I will uncover everything! 
        The truth will come to light!</p>
